				The chief scientist meets you at the entrance:

				"Are you interested in helping us to learn more about the Iocrym?
				We're studying the spacetime distortion that the Iocrym are
				generating around the Heretic sun. Our only lead is a weak graviton
				anomaly coming from somewhere in the system.

				"Will you help us find it?"

			</Text>
			<Text id="textBriefing">

				"We need you to deploy a series of probes to pinpoint the graviton
				anomaly. Each probe that you deploy will tell you something about
				the position of the anomaly. Use that information to deploy the
				next probe as close as possible to the anomaly. You must deploy one
				probe within 10 light-seconds of the anomaly in order for us to
				get any useful data.

				"Will you help us?"

				"I'm almost positive that the graviton anomaly is related to the
				quarantine. If we could just study it, perhaps we could find a way
				to break out of this trap and into the rest of the galaxy."

				"You haven't found the anomaly yet and you still have probes left!"

				"Remember, each probe tells you something about the position of the

			<Text id="SuccessDebrief">

				The chief scientist greets you as you enter:

				"The data you gathered on the graviton anomaly is amazing. It looks
				like the Iocrym can affect the core of a star!

				"Take this data ROM and share it with the Svalbard Explorer; they
				may be able to use it."

				"There's one more thing: we've detected recent energy readings at the
				edge of the system. Starships of some sort are entering the system.
				If I had to guess, I'd say that the Iocrym are back. Be careful."
